I'm a third year undergraduate student in the Department of Mathematics enrolled in it's integrated course of Mathematics and Computing at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.

I'm interested in Machine Learning, more specifically in Deep Learning. I'm fascinated by the application of Deep Learning methods in solving problems from domains as varied as Robotics, Computer Vision, Health, Biology and so on.

I maintain this blog as a medium of expressing myself on my adventures as a learner. I am still a learner myself and I found writing stuff as the best way to understand. The posts typically would be related to Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Robotics, the fields that I'm most excited about.
