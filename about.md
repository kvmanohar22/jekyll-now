 Yet another human roaming the earth

I'm a third year undergraduate student in the Department of Mathematics enrolled in it's integrated course of Mathematics and Computing at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.

I'm interested in Machine Learning, more specifically Deep Learning. I'm fascinated by the application of Deep Learning methods in solving problems from domains as varied as Robotics, Computer Vision, Health, Biology and so on.
