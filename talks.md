- **Computer Vision and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** \\
March 18 2019 | [slides](../images/CLA.pdf) | [supplementary]({{ site.baseurl  }}/images/slides_LA_proof.pdf) \\
As part of [MA60053: Computational Linear Algebra](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~rkannan/cla2019/cla2019.html) course. \\
The talk consisted of applications of Linear Algebra in Computer Vision specifically 3D reconstruction.
Due to audience from different fields, I first covered basics of Image formation, transformations.
